# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

![mission_to_mars](Images/mission_to_mars.png)

In this assignment, you will build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.


## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scrape the [Mars News Site](https://redplanetscience.com/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.


### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visit the url for the Featured Space Image site [here](https://spaceimages-mars.com).

* Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

* Make sure to find the image url to the full size `.jpg` image.

* Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.

### Mars Facts

* Visit the Mars Facts webpage [here](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com) and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Use Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the astrogeology site [here](https://marshemispheres.com/) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.

* Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.
